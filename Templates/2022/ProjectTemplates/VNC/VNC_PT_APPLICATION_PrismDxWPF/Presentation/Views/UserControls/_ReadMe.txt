$xxxAPPLICATIONxxx$$xxxNAMESPACExxx$\Presentation\Views\UserControls\

This folder contains UserControls that likely derive from vncmvvm:ViewBase
Unlike UserControls in Presentation\Views, these UserControls do not have an associated ViewModel
If there is code in the xaml.cs file, it should only do UI manipulations and not have Domain impact.
They typically encapsulate reusable Xaml that is placed in the Views.

Namespace remains Presentation\Views
